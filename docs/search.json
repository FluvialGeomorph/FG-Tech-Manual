However, this does not mean that water surface elevation (WSE) cannot be derived from or accurately represented in LiDAR datasets. The elevation of water areas in DEMs derived from LiDAR point clouds can be represented due to the acquisition of points along the water’s edge. See Figure x1 for an illustration of where these points are located.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiDAR Points Acquired Close to the Water’s Edge Define the Water Surface. Mississippi River, RM 435, Vicksburg, MS.\n\n\n\n\nThe point cloud density will largely determine how accurately the water surface is captured, driven by the probability of capturing points as close to the water line as possible. In relatively low point cloud density LiDAR collections (&gt;=1m point cloud spacing) the water surface is often represented with artifacts. These artifacts are commonly referred to as TIN (Triangulated Irregular Networks) artifacts created when the DEM is derived. These occur when LiDAR points were not regularly acquired close to the water’s edge. Sections of the banklines where LiDAR points were not acquired close to the water’s edge will appear as triangular “humps” in the water surface. In Figure x2, these “hump” artifacts are clearly visible as reddish areas, while the lower elevation areas close to the water surface elevation appears as green and blue areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nDEM artifacts due to LiDAR points not being captured close enough to the water’s edge.

    "text": "Feature Classes\nFluvialGeomorph defines a standard set of feature classes that are used through the tool chain. The definition of a common set of derived features is an important step in standardizing the FluvialGeomorph workflow. These database objects form a tightly linked set of features that work together in a particular order to accomplish the analysis. They are presented here in the approximate order in which they are produced.\n\nStudy Area\nThe study_area polygon feature class is created manually by the analyst using these instructions from the user manual.\n\n\n\nStudy Area Fields.\n\n\nField Name\nType\nDescription\nUnits\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrain Model Raster\nThe GIS analyst follows these instructions from the user manual using standard ESRI geoprocessing tools to transform a LiDAR point cloud dataset covering the study area into an appropriately resolute (pixel cell size) digital elevation model (DEM). Only points representing the ground or water surface are selected from the point cloud to derive the terrain surface DEM.

The cutlines polyline feature class is used to store geometry needed to hydrologically modify a terrain model to ensure that water can accurately flow over the land surface as it does in the real world. LiDAR derived terrain models frequently contain flow blockages (e.g., road berms) that must be “cut-through” to represent the presence of flow structures (e.g., culverts, bridges) that cannot be resolved directly from the LiDAR terrain model.\n\n\n\nCutlines Fields.\n\n\nField Name\nType\nDescription\nUnits\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydro Modified Raster\nBefore the dem terrain model raster can be used for synthetically deriving stream features, it must first be hydrologically modified using the cutlines feature class to “burn” flow paths into the dem raster.

Cross sections are polyline feature classes drawn perpendicular to the flowline feature and are long enough to extend across some portion of the channel and floodplain. Cross section features are used to define channel cross section dimensions. Regular cross sections are spaced equal distances longitudinally along the flowline. Regularly spaced cross sections are used to sample conditions within a stream reach to display a continuous series of values and calculate aggregate stream values.\n\n\n\nRegular Cross Section Fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Name\nType\nDescription\nUnits\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nReachName\ntext\nName of the reach.\n\n1\n\n\nSeq\nshort\nThe cross section unique identifier.\n\n1\n\n\nx_start\ndouble\nThe x-coordinate value at the start of the cross section.\nlinear units of fc\n1\n\n\ny_start\ndouble\nThe y-coordinate value at the start of the cross section.\nlinear units of fc\n1\n\n\nx_end\ndouble\nThe x-coordinate value at the end of the cross section.\nlinear units of fc\n1\n\n\ny_end\ndouble\nThe y-coordinate value at the end of the cross section.\nlinear units of fc\n1\n\n\nWatershed_Area_SqMile\ndouble\nThe upstream watershed drainage area.\nsquare miles\n1\n\n\nfrom_measure\ndouble\nThe start longitudinal stationing value for the reach.\nkilometers\n1\n\n\nto_measure\ndouble\nThe end longitudinal stationing value for the reach.\nkilometers\n1\n\n\nPOINT_X\ndouble\nThe x-coordinate value (longitude).\nlinear units of fc\n1\n\n\nPOINT_Y\ndouble\nThe y-coordinate value (latitude).\nlinear units of fc\n1\n\n\nPOINT_M\ndouble\nThe m-coordinate value (route position).\nlinear units of fc\n1\n\n\nZ\ndouble\nThe z-coordinate value (elevation).\nfeet, NAVD88\n1\n\n\nkm_to_mouth\ndouble\nThe distance to the mouth of the site.\nkilometers\n1\n\n\nloop\nlong\nThe loop number.\n\n3\n\n\nbend\nlong\nThe bend number.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiffle Cross Sections\nRiffle cross sections (i.e., riffle_floodplain, riffle_channel) are a unique type of cross section manually drawn by the analyst within a riffle stream feature using these instructions from the user manual. In contrast to regularly spaced cross sections that are delineated by a script, riffles irregularly spaced along a stream and are manually drawn by a GIS analyst. Analysts are trained to identify riffles using a set of guidelines from the literature and interpretation of the DEM and aerial imagery. The riffle_floodplain polyline feature class is drawn longitudinally within riffle features and extend laterally across the active floodplain. The riffle_channel polyline feature class is also drawn longitudinally within riffle features, but only extend laterally across the bankfull channel area.\n\n\n\nRiffle Floodplain Riffle Channel Cross Section Fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Name\nType\nDescription\nUnits\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nReachName\ntext\nName of the reach.\n\n2\n\n\nSeq\nshort\nThe cross section unique identifier.\n\n2\n\n\nWatershed_Area_SqMile\ndouble\nThe upstream watershed drainage area.\nsquare miles\n2\n\n\nfrom_measure\ndouble\nThe start longitudinal stationing value for the reach.\nkilometers\n2\n\n\nto_measure\ndouble\nThe end longitudinal stationing value for the reach.\nkilometers\n2\n\n\nPOINT_X\ndouble\nThe x-coordinate value (longitude).\nlinear units of fc\n2\n\n\nPOINT_Y\ndouble\nThe y-coordinate value (latitude).\nlinear units of fc\n2\n\n\nPOINT_M\ndouble\nThe m-coordinate value (route position).\nlinear units of fc\n2\n\n\nZ\ndouble\nThe z-coordinate value (elevation).\nfeet, NAVD88\n2\n\n\nkm_to_mouth\ndouble\nThe distance to the mouth of the site.\nkilometers\n2\n\n\nloop\nlong\nThe loop number.\n\n3\n\n\nbend\nlong\nThe bend number.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section Points\nThe 14 - XS Points tool creates the *_points points feature class using these instructions from the user manual for Level 1 and Level 2. Cross sections polyline feature classes (i.e., regularly spaced cross sections and riffle cross sections: riffle_floodplain, riffle_channel) can be converted to a set of regularly spaced points along the cross section. These points are used to store elevation and route position (lateral stream stationing) information for a cross section feature class. Cross section points are used to calculate a series of cross section dimensions.\n\n\n\nCross Section Points Fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Name\nType\nDescription\nUnits\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nReachName\ntext\nName of the reach.\n\n1,2\n\n\nSeq\nshort\nThe cross section unique identifier.\n\n1,2\n\n\nWatershed_Area_SqMile\ndouble\nThe upstream watershed drainage area.\nsquare miles\n1,2\n\n\nfrom_measure\ndouble\nThe start longitudinal stationing value for the reach.\nkilometers\n1,2\n\n\nto_measure\ndouble\nThe end longitudinal stationing value for the reach.\nkilometers\n1,2\n\n\nPOINT_X\ndouble\nThe x-coordinate value (longitude).\nlinear units of fc\n1,2\n\n\nPOINT_Y\ndouble\nThe y-coordinate value (latitude).\nlinear units of fc\n1,2\n\n\nPOINT_M\ndouble\nThe m-coordinate value (route position).\nlinear units of fc\n1,2\n\n\nPOINT_M_units\ntext\nThe units of the POINT_M field.\n\n1,2\n\n\nkm_to_mouth\ndouble\nThe distance to the mouth of the site.\nkilometers\n1,2\n\n\nDEM_Z\ndouble\nThe z-coordinate value (elevation).\nfeet, NAVD88\n1,2\n\n\ndem_units\ndouble\nThe units of theDEM_Z field.\n\n1,2\n\n\nDetrend_DEM_Z\ndouble\nThe z-coordinate value on the detrended raster.\nfeet, detrended\n1,2\n\n\nloop\nlong\nThe loop number.\n\n3\n\n\nbend\nlong\nThe bend number.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section Dimensions\nCross section dimension polyline feature classes are used to store the hydraulic dimensions calculated for each cross section. Since the FluvialGeomorph workflow is divided into three levels, cross section dimensions are calculated at each level. Each level allows for an increasingly complex set of dimensions to be calculated, with each level building on the complexity of the previous level. There are three cross section dimension feature classes, one for each level *_dims_L1, *_dims_L2, and *_dims_L3. Cross section dimensions are calculated using the following tools:\n\nLevel 1 Dimensions - The 15a XS Dimensions, Level 1 tool creates the *_dims_L1 feature class using these instructions from the user manual.\nLevel 2 Dimensions - The 15b XS Dimensions, Level 2 tool creates the *_dims_L2 feature class using these instructions from the user manual for L2 Initial and L2 Final.\nLevel 3 Dimensions - The 15c XS Planform, Level 3 tool creates the *_dims_L3 feature class using these instructions from the user manual.\n\nCross section dimensions can be calculated for the various types of cross sections (regular cross sections or riffle cross sections). The name of the cross section feature for which dimensions were calculated is prepended to the output dimension feature class. Metrics calculated at previous levels are included in the attribute table of each dimension feature class. Therefore, to avoid repetition only the new fields calculated at each level are included in the tables of fields in this section. The attributes of the original cross section feature class are also omitted since they depend on the cross section type used.\n\n\n\nLevel 1 Cross Section Dimension Fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField

The loop_points point feature class is used to store the longitudinal extents of loops and bends used for planform analysis. Within the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, the term “loop” is defined as a single meander as it swings across the valleyline. Moving downstream along a single loop, once the stream swings substantially across the valleyline, another loop begins. The point of maximum distance of a flowline from the valeyline (laterally across the floodplain) defines a loop “apex”. Moving to a finer scale, “bends” are defined as stream undulations within a particular loop. Therefore, a single loop may contain many bends. These loop and bend extents and loop apices are used to calculate a set of planform dimensions.\n\n\n\nLoop Points Fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Name\nType\nDescription\nUnits\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nReachName\ntext\nName of the reach.\n\n3\n\n\nloop\nlong\nThe loop number.\n\n3\n\n\nbend\nlong\nThe bend number.\n\n3\n\n\nposition\ntext\nThe planform location indicator.
