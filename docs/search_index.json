Regional Sediment Management Program (RSM) Mississippi River Geomorphology and Potamology Program (MRG&amp;P) Flood Risk Management Program (FRM) Engineering With Nature (EWN) 0.1 Abstract The FluvialGeomorph ArcGIS toolbox provides a set of tools for conducting rapid fluvial geomorphology analysis and assessment. It allows a user to use high resolution, remotely sensed LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) terrain data to cost effectively extract stream channel dimensions at fine scale for large spatial extents. This document describes the methods used in the development of the FluvialGeomorph project. 0.2 Distribution Statement Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited 0.3 Unit Conversion Factors Unit Conversion Factors Multiply By To Obtain feet 0.3048 meters miles 1.60934 kilometers square miles 2.58999 square kilometers 0.4 Notation List "]]
