# Introduction
This chapter describes the background and approach used in the development of the FluvialGeomorph project. 

## Purpose
* Document the methods used in FluvialGeomorph
* Establish a common set of concepts and terminology between fluvial geomorphologists, geospatial analysts, and biologists/ecologists
* define terms
* Describe tools
* Describe products

## FluvialGeomorph Goals
* Develop reproducible methods for analyzing streams using remote sensing data
* Develop a set of fluvial feature extraction tools
* Develop methods that take advantage of the wealth on new LiDAR survey data

## Design Philosophy
* Open source
* Establish a framework to build upon
* Combine best-of-breed tools
* Opinionated API
* Standardize reporting products

## Previous Work
* River Bathymetry Toolkit
* TauDEM

## Other Resources
* How to use the tools is described in the user manual
* Application of this approach is described in other technical reports.
