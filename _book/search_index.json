It summarizes the research problem, project objective, and outcome of the investigation. It should run no more than 200 words. 0.2 Disclaimer Also on the reverse side of the title page is the standard disclaimer of any implied government endorsement of products discussed in text. 0.3 Distribution Statement The distribution statement is a critical component of both the cover and the title page. Every ERDC technical publication must be imprinted with one of the seven primary distribution statements required by Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5230.24. A distribution statement constitutes ERDC’s decision on who is authorized to read the report. Most reports published by ERDC are intended for unrestricted public access and carry Statement A: “Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.” However, access to many reports may need to be restricted for reasons ranging from proprietary information content to national security interests related to militarily critical technology. Appendix B presents the text of every nonclassified distribution statement and the approved justifica- ERDC/ITL SR-04-1 8 tions for applying each one. Only reports labeled with Statement A shall be posted to the World Wide Web for unrestricted public access. 0.4 Unit Conversion Factors A unit conversion factors table is included in all reports that do not use metric units or dual units. The table should include only those U.S. customary units used in the report. It should be compiled from the master list of conversion factors maintained by PTTB. For more information, see “Expressing and converting units of measure” (page 14). 0.5 Notation List A notation list also may be included to define characters, symbols, and abbreviations used to express technical facts or quantities. It appears after the unit conversion factors. Figure A4 presents a formatted sample. "],
